This inspection reports dangerous operations inside constructors including:
<ul>
  <li>Accessing non-final property in constructor</li>
  <li>Calling non-final function in constructor</li>
  <li>Using 'this' as function argument in constructor of non-final class</li>
</ul>
These operations are dangerous because your class can be inherited,
and derived class is not yet initialized at this moment. Typical example:
<code>
abstract class Base {
    val code = calculate()
    abstract fun calculate(): Int
}
class Derived(private val x: Int) : Base() {
    override fun calculate() = x
}
fun testIt() {
    println(Derived(42).code) // Expected: 42, actual: 0
}
</code>
